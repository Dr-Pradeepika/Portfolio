  <h3>About me: </h3>
  <p>I graduated plus post-graduated with first-rank holder honours in Geology / Earth Science from <a href="https://www.amu.ac.in/">Aligarh Muslim University</a>, India, before undertaking my full time PhD entitled “Geomorphic Evolution of Chambal
    River Baisn
    using Remote Sensing and GIS Techniques”(2019) with the <a href="http://www.bhu.ac.in/">Banaras Hindu University</a>, India. I was awarded by prestigious AORC DST-INSPIRE research fellowship (http:+//www.inspire-dst.gov.in/) for PhD funding. This
    research
    period involved 2-5 years to examine and analysed the geomorphic evolution of Chambal river basin, India with using Remote sensed data (SAR/Landsat/SRTM/ASTER/LISS/Resource etc.) and GIS technology. Between this tenure, I got the chance to extend
    my research expertise and specialization with GIS methodology at geographical and Earth science department of Glasgow University, UK. In addition to my academic achievements, I spent 4 years as an assistant professor (tenure of PhD) at Earth
    science department at Banasthali University, India. Banasthali University is the world second largest residential university for women <a href="http://www.banasthali.org/banasthali/wcms/en/home/">Banasthali University</a>. During this experience,
    working towards full professorship, administrative roles, student intellectual, organizing Conferences and COSMOS event for motivating student toward for geoscience career, developing the skills as a team leader and also investing energy into
    geoscience placement
    cell. I also extend my skill as a dedicated student counsellor for helping students to overcome issues such as stress, exam worry, bullying and helping with their ongoing educational opportunities. With the designation as a project scientist
    (2012-13), I gained and enjoyed my industrial experience with an amazing team at the in Geomorphic and lineament mapping project of Geological Survey of India (GSI) and Indian space research organization (ISRO).

    <br>
    I am curious to use my innovative ideas with qualities of independence, creativity, and critical thinking with my advance technical skills in computer, ArcPy, R, Python, ArcGIS Pro, ArcGIS web application and programming,
    Georeferencing-geo-mapping, Photogrammetry, Remote
    sensing, Web Mapping, ArcSWAT, Hydrology, Arc-GIS Desktop, ENVI, SNAP, LIDAR, SAR, 3D MODELLING, ERDAS, ILWIS, QGIS, AutoCAD, 3D modelling would be an asset to your team. I am confident that this position in your team would provide me open space
    to work and share knowledge with a new energetic team environment. I am a seeker and always ready to explore new objectives at diverse scale and using GIS in my core interest. In the position at your company , I will be able to combine my
    academic knowledge as well as my practical experience.

    <br>
    I am looking forward to taking the challenge to work for your organization. I have gone through your website and read all necessary information about mission, vision of organization, pattern
    of work, facilitate of working environment and your group culture. That is the reason, I am excited about the job. Other things, I believe that the benefits of this position, I will be getting in three-fold. First, it offers complete freedom to
    pursue my remote sensing work interests and to develop novel approaches and technologies, without the constraints of deliverable-driven project research. Second, this position helps me to get fund, which is enough time to develop as an
    independent investigator and begin to build a team group, which in turn provides the opportunity to address some key knowledge gaps in oceanography or geoscience. Third, the scheme is wellfunded and provides the resources necessary to combine
    analytical techniques with large-scale fieldwork, which is needed to better understand climate change with endo-exogenetic geomorphic impacts on surface concerning the Earth surface. I would like to enhance this research with using several
    methods, including image interpretation (visible, infrared, radar), laboratory work, remote sensing data fieldwork, infrared spectroscopy, geophysical data interpretation, modelling and laboratory work. Therefore, this position has allowed me to
    establish an international, multidisciplinary working group, comprising ecologists, cartographers, climatologists and environmental planetary scientists, with the aim of better understanding the patterns, drivers and impacts on Earth, which has
    led to papers in journals and reports. Motivation Letter 2 Save Tree Save Earth Save Life Tenure of my PhD.

    <br>
    I felt very motivated by something I've found out and wanted to share this with you. I am a passionate marathon runner and wish to explore the world. I finished TCS 8km, 21km Mizuno Half Marathon and still going on.
